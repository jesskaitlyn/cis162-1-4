    <p>I love the color pink, scrapbooking, and traveling! Pink has always been my favorite color growing up, it is the one thing I haven't grown out of. I oe apturing my memories in special ways, so I do that through scrapbooking. I also love gaining new experiences, especially through traveling, because it allows me to experience different things in a variety of ways!</p>
